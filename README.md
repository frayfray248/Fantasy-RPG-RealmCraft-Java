# Fantasy-RPG-RealmCraft-Java
This is the start of a tile-based fantasy RPG I created in the summer of 2019. I made this project to practice my game development/Java skills. I learned how to make it by following a series of YouTube videos uploaded by a user named CodeNMore (see link below). His videos were very helpful but after episode 34 (which was the last one at the time), I figured out how to add my own features to the project such as my inventory screen. The particular knowledge I gained from making this project was game engine development, abstract classes, Java Interfaces, Spritesheets, and 2D animation.
# Features
This game is very incomplete but the following is a list of features currently implemented:
- Walk around in a 2D tile environment
- Fight enemies
- Attack Trees and rocks and pick up their "drops"
- Move or Drop items in an inventory screen
- Launch game in a start menu
